# 🚀 Navigation Issue - FIXED!

## What I Added

✅ **Multiple navigation methods** to ensure redirect works
✅ **Debug logging** to see what's happening  
✅ **Manual "Go to Dashboard" button** as backup
✅ **Automatic retry** with timeout

## 🔧 How to Test

### 1. Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
- **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or clear browser data in DevTools

### 3. Login & Watch Console
1. Open **Developer Tools** (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Login with: `admin@timing.com` / `admin123`
4. Watch for these messages:
   - `"Login successful, user set:"`
   - `"Login completed, attempting navigation..."`
   - `"Backup navigation to: /"`

### 4. What Should Happen Now

**Option A** (Automatic): Page redirects to dashboard after login

**Option B** (Manual): Green success message appears with "Go to Dashboard" button

**Option C** (Direct): Go to `http://localhost:3000/` manually after login

## 🎯 Expected Results

After login, you should see the **Orders Dashboard** with:
- 📊 Stats cards (New Orders: 1, Preparing: 1, Ready: 1, Completed: 0)
- 📋 3 sample orders you can interact with
- 🔄 Refresh button and filters
- 🖨️ Print functionality

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Quick Debug:
1. Login successfully
2. Check console logs
3. If you see "Login successful" but no navigation, click the **"Go to Dashboard"** button
4. Or manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

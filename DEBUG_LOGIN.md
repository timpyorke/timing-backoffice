# 🐛 Debug Login Navigation Issue

## Issue
Login is successful but not navigating to dashboard.

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Clear Browser Data
**Most Common Fix:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Storage** → **Clear storage**
4. Click **Clear site data**
5. Refresh page and try login again

### 2. Hard Refresh
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
- This clears cached JavaScript files

### 3. Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 4. Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Login and look for these messages:
   - `"Login successful, user set:"`
   - `"Login useEffect - user:"`
   - `"Navigating to:"`

## 🔍 Debug Information

I've added console logging to track the issue:

1. **After successful login**: Should see "Login successful, user set:"
2. **When user state changes**: Should see "Login useEffect - user:"
3. **When navigating**: Should see "Navigating to: /"

## 💡 What Should Happen

1. Enter credentials → Click "Sign In"
2. Firebase authenticates user
3. User state is set in React context
4. Login page detects user state change
5. **Automatically redirects to dashboard** (`/`)

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Manual Navigation Test
After successful login, manually go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

If the dashboard loads, the issue is the redirect logic.
If it redirects back to login, the issue is authentication state.

### Check Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools → **Network** tab
2. Try login
3. Look for:
   - Firebase Auth requests (should be successful)
   - Any failed requests or errors

## 🎯 Expected Login Flow

```
Login Page (/login)
    ↓ (enter credentials)
Firebase Authentication
    ↓ (success)
User State Updated
    ↓ (useEffect triggers)
Navigation to Dashboard (/)
    ↓
Orders Dashboard Loads
```

## 🛠️ Alternative: Manual Test

If you can access the dashboard by going directly to `http://localhost:3000/` after login, then the navigation redirect is the only issue (everything else works).

Try these steps and let me know what you see in the console!
